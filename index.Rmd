# Forward {-}

The world confronts us. Make decisions we must.

# Warning {-}

This book is not the book you are looking for.

First, the book is for students in [Gov 1005: Data](https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_1005.html), a course offered in the Government Department at Harvard University. Everything about the book is designed to make the experience of those students better. Some of the material here may be useful to students outside of this class, but I don't really care if it is.

Second, the book changes all the time. It is as up-to-date as possible.

Third, I am highly opinionated about what matters and what does not. It is unlikely that you share my views.

And what is romantic, Kay ---  
And what is love?  
Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?
