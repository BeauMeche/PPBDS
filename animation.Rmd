# Animation

<!-- Self-contained introduction to animation.  We will only be using gganimate. Start with this introduction: https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/gganimate-how-to-create-plots-with-beautiful-animation-in-r/. You may copy it exactly (I have permission) but we should provide a link back to the original. Make sure o cover anim_save() since students need to save their anmations and then deply them to Shiny. The gganimate official page is OK: https://gganimate.com/index.html. The section "Where is my animation?" is definitely important, as is understanding that the default creation is a gif. Should also cover how to post one's gif on Facebook/Twitter/etc. -->
