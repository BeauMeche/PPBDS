<!-- What problems do we face? All the things that make modeling difficult. Why is this so hard? -->

<!-- Centering. -->

<!-- Might naively just take the value for each bucket. But that overfits! Need to put down some structure, like ordering. -->

<!-- income category, party id, pooling, age, -->

<!-- overfitting/underfitting bias/variance -->

<!-- We must have left bootstrapping behind by now. No more bootstraps, at least for the purpose of calculating uncertainty. (We will use it later for the purpose of out-of-sample testing and avoiding overfitting.) Key lesson is that overfitting is easy. You can't just estimate a value for each cell. You need to smooth and borrow strength. Of course, the only way to do that is with a Bayesian approach. Right? We don't want to get into hacked likelihood approaches. -->

<!-- cces looks perfect for this project. There are 400,000 rows, so it seems like you ought to have plenty of data for anything you want, but once you realize there are 51 states and 10 years, things get sparse fast. We only have 15 observations, for example, for Wyoming in 2007. Once you start subsetting by race and education, you have no choice but to start borrowing strength.  -->

<!-- So, just what will we use? rstanarm(). If so (and if we have not introduced it earlier), we can begin with seeing how it is similar to lm() and then expand. This means that, in one paramter chapter, we should be doing lm( ~ 1). In two parameter, lm( ~ treatment) --- if treatment is zero one --- or, perhaps better, lm( ~ -1 + treatment) if treatment is a factor/character with two levels. We might also have introduced  -->
