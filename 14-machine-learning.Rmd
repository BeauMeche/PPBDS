# Machine Learning {#machine-learning}

Perhaps the most popular data science methodologies come from the field of _machine learning_. Machine learning success stories include the handwritten zip code readers implemented by the postal service, speech recognition technology such as Apple's Siri, movie recommendation systems, spam and malware detectors, housing price predictors, and driverless cars. Although today Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are often used interchangeably, we make the following distinction: while the first artificial intelligence algorithms, such as those used by chess playing machines, implemented decision making based on programmable rules derived from theory or first principles, in machine learning decisions are based on algorithms **built with data**. 

## Notation

In machine learning, data comes in the form of:

1. the _outcome_ we want to predict and 
2. the _predictors_ that we will use to predict the outcome

We want to build an algorithm that takes predictor values as input and returns a prediction for the outcome when we don't know the outcome. The machine learning approach is to _train_ an algorithm using a dataset for which we do know the outcome, and then apply this algorithm in the future to make a prediction when we don't know the outcome.

Here we will use $Y$ to denote the outcome and $X_1, \dots, X_p$ to denote predictors. Note that predictors are sometimes referred to as *features* or *covariates*. We consider all these to be synonyms.

Prediction problems can be divided into categorical and continuous outcomes. For categorical outcomes, $Y$ can be any one of $K$ classes. The number of classes can vary greatly across applications.

The general setup is as follows. We have a series of predictors and an unknown outcome we want to predict:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(dslabs)
tmp <- tibble(outcome="?", 
              'predictor 1' = "$X_1$",
              'predictor 2' = "$X_2$",
              'predictor 3' = "$X_3$",
              'predictor 4' = "$X_4$",
              'predictor 5' = "$X_5$")
if(knitr::is_html_output()){
  knitr::kable(tmp, "html", align = "c") %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
} else{
  knitr::kable(tmp, "latex", align="c", escape = FALSE, booktabs = TRUE) %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 8)
}
```

To _build a model_ that provides a prediction for any set of observed values $X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2, \dots X_5=x_5$, we collect data for which we know the outcome:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
n <- 2
tmp <- tibble(outcome = paste0("$y_{", 1:n,"}$"), 
              'predictor 1' = paste0("$x_{",1:n,",1}$"),
              'predictor 2' = paste0("$x_{",1:n,",2}$"),
              'predictor 3' = paste0("$x_{",1:n,",3}$"),
              'predictor 4' = paste0("$x_{",1:n,",4}$"),
              'predictor 5' = paste0("$x_{",1:n,",5}$"))
tmp_2 <- rbind(c("$\\vdots$", "$\\vdots$", "$\\vdots$", "$\\vdots$", "$\\vdots$", "$\\vdots$"),
               c("$y_n$", "$x_{n,1}$","$x_{n,2}$","$x_{n,3}$","$x_{n,4}$","$x_{n,5}$"))
colnames(tmp_2) <- names(tmp)
tmp <- bind_rows(tmp, as_tibble(tmp_2))
if(knitr::is_html_output()){
  knitr::kable(tmp, "html") %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
} else{
  knitr::kable(tmp, "latex", escape = FALSE, booktabs = TRUE) %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 8)
}
```

When the output is continuous we refer to the machine learning task as _prediction_, and the main output of the model is a function $f$ that automatically produces a prediction, denoted with $\hat{y}$, for any set of predictors: $\hat{y} = f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_p)$.  We use the term _actual outcome_ to denote what we ended up observing. So we want the prediction $\hat{y}$ to match the actual outcome $y$ as well as possible. Because our outcome is continuous, our predictions $\hat{y}$ will not be either exactly right or wrong, but instead we will determine an _error_ defined as the difference between the prediction and the actual outcome $y - \hat{y}$.

When the outcome is categorical, we refer to the machine learning task as _classification_, and the main output of the model will be a _decision rule_ which prescribes which of the $K$ classes we should predict. In this scenario, most models provide functions of the predictors for each class $k$, $f_k(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_p)$, that are used to make this decision. When the data is binary a typical decision rules looks like this: if $f_1(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_p) > C$, predict category 1, if not the other category, with $C$ a predetermined cutoff. Because the outcomes are categorical, our predictions will be either right or wrong. 

## Evaluation metrics

Before we start describing approaches to optimize the way we build algorithms, we first need to define what we mean when we say one approach is better than another. In this section, we focus on describing ways in which machine learning algorithms are evaluated. Specifically, we need to quantify what we mean by "better".

### Training and test sets

Ultimately, a machine learning algorithm is evaluated on how it performs in the real world with completely new datasets. However, when developing an algorithm, we usually have a dataset for which we know the outcomes. Therefore, to mimic the ultimate evaluation process, we typically split the data into two parts and act as if we don't know the outcome for one of these. We stop pretending we don't know the outcome to evaluate the algorithm, but only *after* we are done constructing it. We refer to the group for which we know the outcome, and use to develop the algorithm, as the _training_ set. We refer to the group for which we pretend we don't know the outcome as the _test_ set. 

A standard way of generating the training and test sets is by randomly splitting the data.

We will then develop an algorithm using **only** the training set. Once we are done developing the algorithm, we will _freeze_ it and evaluate it using the test set.

But remember, **it is important that we optimize the model using only the training set**: the test set is only for evaluation. Evaluating an algorithm on the training set can lead to _overfitting_, which often results in dangerously over-optimistic assessments. 

### The loss function {#loss-function}

In this section, we describe how the general approach to defining "best" in machine learning is to define a _loss function_, which can be applied to both categorical and continuous data. 

The most commonly used loss function is the squared loss function. If $\hat{y}$ is our predictor and $y$ is the observed outcome, the squared loss function is simply:

$$
(\hat{y} - y)^2
$$

Because we often have a test set with many observations, say $N$, we use the mean squared error (MSE):

$$
MSE = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2
$$

In practice, we often report the root mean squared error (RMSE), which is $\sqrt{\mbox{MSE}}$, because it is in the same units as the outcomes. But doing the math is often easier with the MSE and it is therefore more commonly used in textbooks, since these usually describe theoretical properties of algorithms.

If the outcomes are binary, both RMSE and MSE are equivalent to accuracy, since $(\hat{y} - y)^2$ is 0 if the prediction was correct and 1 otherwise. In general, our goal is to build an algorithm that minimizes the loss so it is as close to 0 as possible.

Note that there are loss functions other than the squared loss. For example, the _Mean Absolute Error_  uses absolute values, $|\hat{Y}_i - Y_i|$ instead of squaring the errors$(\hat{Y}_i - Y_i)^2$. However, in this book we focus on minimizing square loss since it is the most widely used.

## Cross validation {#cross-validation}


In this section we introduce cross validation, one of the most important ideas in machine learning. 

In Section \@ref(loss-function), we described that a common goal of machine learning is to find an algorithm that produces predictors $\hat{Y}$ for an outcome $Y$ that minimizes the MSE:

$$
MSE = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2
$$
There are two important characteristics of the MSE we should always keep in mind:

1. We can think our estimate of the MSE is a random variable. For example, the dataset we have may be a random sample from a larger population. An algorithm may have a lower apparent error than another algorithm due to luck.

2. If we train an algorithm on the same dataset that we use to compute the MSE, we might be overtraining. In general, when we do this, the apparent error will be an underestimate of the true error.

Cross validation is a technique that permits us to alleviate both these problems. To understand cross validation, it helps to think of the *true error*, a theoretical quantity, as the average of many *apparent errors* obtained by applying the algorithm to new random samples of the data, none of them used to train the algorithm. 

However, we only have available one set of outcomes: the ones we actually observed. Cross validation is based on the idea of generating a series of different random samples on which to apply our algorithm. There are several approaches we can use, but the general idea for all of them is to randomly generate smaller datasets that are not used for training, and instead used to estimate the true error.

### K-fold cross validation


```{r, include=FALSE}
if(knitr::is_html_output()){
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width = "500px",
                        out.extra='style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color: #000; padding:3px;"')
} else{
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width = "35%")
}
```

The first approach we describe is _K-fold cross validation_. 

Generally speaking, a machine learning challenge starts with a dataset (blue in the image below). We need to build an algorithm using this dataset that will eventually be used in completely independent datasets (yellow).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cv-1.png")
```

But we don't get to see these independent datasets. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cv-2.png")
```

So to imitate this situation, we carve out a piece of our dataset and pretend it is an independent dataset: we divide the dataset into a _training set_ (blue) and a _test set_ (red). We will train our algorithm exclusively on the training set and use the test set only for evaluation purposes.

We usually try to select a small piece of the dataset so that we have as much data as possible to train. However, we also want the test set to be large so that we obtain a stable estimate of the loss without fitting an impractical number of models. Typical choices are to use 10%-20% of the data for testing. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cv-3.png")
```

Let's reiterate that it is indispensable that we not use the test set at all: not for filtering out rows, not for selecting predictors, nothing! 

Now this presents a new problem because for most machine learning algorithms we need to select parameters. We need to optimize algorithm parameters without using our test set and we know that if we optimize and evaluate on the same dataset, we will overtrain.  This is where cross validation is most useful.

For each set of algorithm parameters being considered, we want an estimate of the MSE and then we will choose the parameters with the smallest MSE. Cross validation provides this estimate.

First, before we start the cross validation procedure, it is important to fix all the algorithm parameters. Although we will train the algorithm on the set of training sets, the parameters will be the same across all training sets.

Let's start by describing how to construct the first: we simply pick $M=N/K$ observations at random (we round if $M$ is not a round number) and think of these as a random sample. We call this the *validation set*:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cv-4.png")
```

Now we can fit the model in the training set, then compute the MSE on the validation set.  Note that this is just one sample and will therefore return a noisy estimate of the true error. This is why we take $K$ samples, not just one. In K-cross validation, we randomly split the observations into $K$ non-overlapping sets:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cv-5.png")
```

Then, for our final estimate, we compute the average MSE across our $K$ samples.

A final step would be to select the set of parameters that minimizes the MSE.

We have described how to use cross validation to optimize parameters. However, we now have to take into account the fact that the optimization occurred on the training data and therefore we need an estimate of our final algorithm based on data that was not used to optimize the choice. Here is where we use the test set we separated early on:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cv-6.png")
```

We can do cross validation again:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cv-7.png")
```

and obtain a final estimate of our expected loss. However, note that this means that our entire compute time gets multiplied by $K$. You will soon learn that performing this task takes time because we are performing many complex computations. As a result, we are always looking for ways to reduce this time. For the final evaluation, we often just use the one test set.

Once we are satisfied with this model and want to make it available to others, we could refit the model on the entire dataset, without changing the optimized parameters.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cv-8.png")
```


Now how do we pick the cross validation $K$? Large values of $K$ are preferable because the training data better imitates the original dataset. However, larger values of $K$ will have much slower computation time: for example, 100-fold cross validation will be 10 times slower than 10-fold cross validation. For this reason, the choices of $K=5$ and $K=10$ are popular.

### Bootstrap

One way we can improve the variance of our final estimate is to take more samples. To do this, we would no longer require the training set to be partitioned into non-overlapping sets. Instead, we would just pick $K$ sets of some size at random.

One popular version of this technique, at each fold, picks observations at random with replacement (which means the same observation can appear twice). This approach has some advantages (not discussed here) and is generally referred to as the _bootstrap_.
