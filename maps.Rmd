# Maps

<!-- Self-contained introduction to mapping. -->

<!-- First, provide a self-contained introduction to tidycensus. Use the excuse: "Before we can create maps, we must get data." These articles  (https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html and https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/articles/spatial-data.html) are not bad. But they are too detailed. Needs to be simpler. Note that this is not open sourced, so you can't just copy and paste. But we can/should follow it very closely. Students will need to get census API keys.  -->

<!-- Second, use [Andrew Tran](https://github.com/andrewbtran/NICAR-2019-mapping) which is open source. Just copy the whole thing as a starting point. Then, rest of time, clean up and clarify as best you can. -->

<!-- This chapter is important because there is no simple, modern self-contained introduction to mapping, using geom_sf(),  that I can find. And lots of students will want to use maps in their final project. But this does need to be simple since students will be going through it during week 4. -->
