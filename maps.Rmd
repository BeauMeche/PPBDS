# Maps

<!-- Self-contained introduction to mapping. Only uses geom_sf(). Use [Andrew Tran](https://github.com/andrewbtran/NICAR-2019-mapping) which is open source. Just copy the whole thing as a starting point.  This chapter is important because there is no simple, modern self-contained introduction to mapping that I can find. And lots of students will want to use maps in their final project. But this does need to be simple since students will be going through it during week 4. Can we get students using tidycensus? https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/articles/spatial-data.html Maybe this should form the core of our examples? Maybe we introduce the tidycensus package the week before in the syllabus? For purposes of this chapter, you may assume that students already understand tidycensus. -->
